# Matrix-Calculator.io
Python code to solve your Matrix problems in a easy way. You can use this calculator in 2 forms. UI and API/GUI. We are working on this calculator daily. So new features will be updated and upcoming bugs will be fixed.

# 1. How To Use
1.1. Solve your Matrix problems in 3 easy steps.

            Step 1: Enter the Operator no. from the Menu.
            Step 2: Make your Matrix's structure entering row and column no.
            Step 3: Enter the elements of the Matrix.

1.2. For now, you can perform the operations only with 1 or 2 matrices.

1.3. (Optional) Change the path/import statement in the ./main_UI.py/ file.

    1.3.1 In the current code the path/import statement is ```from matrix_class import Matrix, menu```
    
    1.3.2 To follow the same convention, make sure both the files are in one same folder.
    
1.4 Download the zip file of this repo. or clone this repo to use this UI claculator.
